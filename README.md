A CLI application that provides users with all the available transportation options in their map, according to their needs.

## Technical Practices

-   Components will be separated into header (.h) files and source (.cpp) files
-   Apply OOP principles
-   C++11 following Google's C++ style sheet
-   File names & branch names -> snake_case
-   Class names -> PascalCase
-   Methods & Attributes & Functions -> camelCase

## Contribution

-   add your header files in ./include
-   add your source files in ./src

-   build using cmake

-   run the application
