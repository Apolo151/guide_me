# guide_me

A CLI application that provides users with all the available transportation options, according to their needs.

## Technical Practices

-   Components will be separated in to header (.h) files and source (.cpp) files
-   Apply OOP principles
-   C++11 following Google's C++ style sheet
-   File names & branch names -> snake case
-   Class names -> Pascal Case
-   Methods & Attributes & Functions -> Camel Case

## Local Setup

### Configure C++ and Cmake

## Contribution

-   add your header files in ./include
-   add your source files in ./src

-   build using cmake

-   run the application
